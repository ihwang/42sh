Gj man, btw there are some bugs i have found
1: segfaul when i type 'fc -e'
2: somehow I managed got double free from command
	'fc -e vim 40-43', but I couldnot reproduce it again
	for some reasons
3: it seems like in bash, the fc command will not be listed
	in the .history file except for 'fc -l' which is included
	in the .bash_history or 'history command'
4. In the case there is no text-editor, in my case i dont have
	emacs on mine pc.
	Firstly I typed command ls
	Secondly I typed fc -e emacs
	Result => I have output of
	a, emacs: command not found
	b; result from the previous ls command
5. When I am testing, I open the file .history with 
	'tail -f .history' to check the command in the history file
	, I noticed there are a couple of strange things and
	it could be a big bugs like:
	a, There is some strange character was added to the history file, with the
		command echo I guess, sr I didnt record, so these type of erros are rare
		and it hard for me to reproduce
	b, When I execute with 'fc -e vim <range>' then I delete the command line
		, it turned out I can delete the whole screen for some reason
		, however I couldnt reproduce it, I should have record the session
	c, output of 'fc -e vim <range>', and in range filed, i chose ls command only
		, It turned out in the history, it appends
		ls;ls;ls;ls;ls;ls. And because of that thing, it will cause a infinite
		loop if u type the command 'fc -e vim <the_last_added_line_in_history>,
		for example 'fc -e vim 50 50'
6. When I deleted the .history file, the shell didnt create a new one and still
	run like normal
7. In fc -e <range>, range can be negative too, but seems not working
8. I am not sure if it is a bug but
	output of 'fc ls pwd' => '42sh: fc: history specification out of range'
