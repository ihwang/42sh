1. shell.h header files will include all the other header files
2. Put your struct in the struct.h header file when you declare a new struct and include struct.h header file into your own header file
3. General functions that you think you will use it in the next feature or it is not relate to your feature or a function from man page that you wrote your self, put that function in the utilities header file
4. The same with general constants, which will go to constant.h header file
5. Dont declare separate global variable, if you need a global variable, declare it in global variable g_shell, which will include every global variable in order to keep track all the global variable. And remember to initialize the value yourself since you put it in g_shell.
